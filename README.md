# WorkshopProject

~~~~~ Why are we doing this? ~~~~~ 

This project is the culmination of the 9 week software development bootcamp, it aims to utilise everything we have learnt and have us build a simple Rest API in springboot using Java. 

~~~~~ How I expected the challenge to go? ~~~~~ 

I expected the challenge to be difficult but acheiveable. 

~~~~~ What went well? What didn't go as planned? ~~~~~ 

Writing the initial code went well, it was when it came to debugging that I found it hard. Integration with SQL was difficult and took a lot of fiddling to get it working. 
I have also had issues with my testing and struggled to get certain tests working. 

~~~~~ Possible improvements for future revisions of the project ~~~~~ 

Improve the testing, add more classes of tools.
